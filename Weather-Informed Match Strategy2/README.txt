To receive customized weather updates, users can set their location. The website provides several features, including lifestyle predictions, movies, and notifications for extreme weather. Modern web technologies are used by AccuWeather.com to provide interactive features and data visualization. Libraries for responsive layouts and dynamic content rendering are part of the codebase.
Wunderground.com
•	Weather Underground offers news about the weather, interactive maps, and hyperlocal weather forecasts. The website offers customizable weather data for particular places together with an easy-to-use interface. In order to receive customized weather updates and forecasts, users can specify their location. The website provides comprehensive meteorological information, including wind speed, temperature, and humidity. Users can investigate local weather conditions with interactive maps. Modern web technologies are used by Weather Underground to produce dynamic content and provide interactive features. The website has responsive design features to ensure the best possible viewing experience on a variety of devices.
Summary
Weather.com, AccuWeather.com, and Wunderground.com offer comprehensive weather forecasts and information with user-friendly interfaces and features. These websites place a high priority on providing customers with precise and customized weather information via engaging features and simple navigation.
Technically speaking, they leverage native mobile development frameworks and contemporary web technologies to provide the best possible user experience and performance.

2.	Repository: weather-api
•	This repository's README is organized neatly and offers detailed instructions on how to utilize the weather API. It contains details on authentication, parameters, API endpoints, and sample queries and answers.
•	For obtaining weather information, the weather-api repository offers a straightforward and user-friendly weather API. The README has comprehensive documentation that makes it simple for developers to include the API into their projects. Understanding the API endpoints, parameters, and authentication techniques are important lessons to learn from the README.
Repository: soccer-match-analysis
•	This repository has an extensive README that includes step-by-step instructions on how to analyze data from soccer matches. It contains details on the preprocessed data, sample analyses, and the dataset that was used.
•	Soccer match data analysis tools and resources are available in the soccer-match-analysis repository. Step-by-step instructions and sample analyses are provided in the README to assist anyone interested in performing their own analysis. Understanding the dataset, preprocessing procedures, and analytical techniques for analyzing soccer match data are important lessons to learn from the README.
Summary
All things considered, both libraries provide insightful materials pertinent to your Weather-Informed Match Strategy project. While the soccer-match-analysis repository gives tools for analyzing soccer match data, the weather-api repository offers a weather API for retrieving weather data. Understanding API usage and data analysis methods unique to weather and soccer match data are important lessons learned from the READMEs.





README

Weather-Informed Match Strategy

Overview:
For soccer matches, real-time weather updates and forecasts are provided by the Weather-Informed Match Strategy app. A thorough explanation of the project, including its present phase, page descriptions, research summary, citations, and resource reflection, is given in this README.

Project Overview:
The project's goal is to develop a web tool that assists soccer teams and organizers in planning matches intelligently, taking into account the weather at the time. The "Today's Forecast" page and the homepage are the two primary pages of the application.

Page Descriptions:
HomePage: 
Conceptual Aspects: The Weather-Informed Match Strategy application is introduced on the homepage, along with its features and advantages for users.
Technical Aspects: To improve visual appeal, the homepage has navigation links.
Todays Forecast:
Conceptual Aspects:This page helps coaches and teams adjust their match strategies based on the weather by showing the most recent weather forecast for today's soccer matches.
Technical Aspects: The page has a navigation bar that leads back to the homepage and a table containing meteorological data.

Research Summary
Website Research: I analyzed the functionality, design, and user experience of websites such as The Wunderground.com, AccuWeather.com, and Weather.com.
essential elements including interactive maps, responsive design, and customized weather updates have been identified.
Repository Research: I searched for pertinent code snippets and structural concepts in repositories like weather-api and soccer-match-analysis.
I discovered some excellent resources for evaluating soccer match data and integrating weather APIs.

Future Enhancements:
Provide interactive elements that allow people to personalize their weather choices.
Include backend features for analyzing and storing data.
Include extra pages with club stats, player bios, and scheduling of games.

Relection on Resources:
Prompts from generative AI offered helpful direction for organizing the project and coming up with ideas.
One of the challenges was locating pertinent repositories and combining data from various sources.
Official documentation and repositories with well-defined READMEs and documentation were considered preferred sources.


References
To make my README cleaner I asked chatgpt the following promt
"Can you make this more professional sounding? Make sure I didnt miss any instructions and everything looks right."
The output gave me a few more ideas to add and better grammar.

For my project i asked chatgpt a question for my custom css code
For the custom CSS instruction i gave it the following instructions
"Can you write a CSS with 3 properties"
It gave me "    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/site.css" asp-append-version="true" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="Weather_Informed_Match_Strategy2.styles.css" asp-append-version="true" />
